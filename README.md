# LiDAR_Sprectal-Analysis
The analysis addresses a common challenge in spectroscopic studies - detecting and  quantifying subtle shifts between spectral datasets
Using MATLAB, I developed and refined a systematic approach to: 
1. Identify System Errors: Detect artificial shifts introduced during measurements 
2. Validate Methodology: Through controlled testing with known shifts 
3. Optimize Analysis: Iteratively improve accuracy through error diagnosis
